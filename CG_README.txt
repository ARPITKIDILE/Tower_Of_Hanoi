Tower_Of_Hanoi Interactive Visualization using OpenGL.

REQUIREMENTS:-

1. Preinstalled glut library.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN:-

1.To move a disk from one tower to another drag and drop the particular disk on desired tower.
2.Once all disks are moved to third tower the game terminates by displaying total moves and time taken.

METHODOLOGY:-

1.Line drawing Algorithm
2.Circle drawing algorithm
3.Ellipse drawing algorithm
4.Polygon filling algorithm
5.Tower of Hanoi algorithm

HOW WE USED IT:-

1.Line drawing algorithm for drawing the towers.
2.Circle and Ellipse drawing algorithm for drawing the disk.
3.Polygon filling algorithm for filling colors in tower and disk.
4.Tower of Hanoi algorithm for demonstrating the visualization with the help of user interactivity.
